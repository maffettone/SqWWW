# Sqare-WWW
This Fortran program applies the Wooten, Winer, and Weaire (WWW) approach to generating continuous random networks for a system of local square planes.

A python implementation of the WWW method is included for clarity; however, the performance of the Fortran algorithm is significantly faster.
